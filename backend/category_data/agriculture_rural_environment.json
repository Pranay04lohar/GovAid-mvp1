    "description": "Prevalence of suitable agro climate has led to natural occurrence of a large number of flowering species in Assam having aesthetic value and horticultural importance. Existence of an ornamental garden is a tradition and characteristic feature of every household in Assam. From time immemorial, the State has been endowed with a rich diversity of flowering annuals and perennials, bulbous ornamental, amazing creepers, ferns and foliage and awesome orchids. In orchid alone, Assam is credited with the natural occurrence of 191 splendid species having diversified forms and wide colour range. Contrary to the potential and scope of commercialization, the State floriculture even till today, is largely confined to household garden as a part of hobby horticulture. The number of commercial pockets can be counted on fingers. Although, the State floriculture sector has shown some amount of growth under the impact of government sponsored development projects like HMNEH, the net position of the State in the National Floriculture Map is yet to be visible. Today, Assam registers an area of 1800 ha under total floriculture which is less than 1% of the total area under floriculture in the country and 7.8% of the total area under floriculture in the neighboring West Bengal.﻿It is further observed that even the neighboring states like West Bengal has a pride position in terms of area and production of flower crops eventually finding its way to the markets in Assam. Today, the incoming flower basket from West Bengal has virtually captured the State's flower market primarily due to low internal production and lack of consistency in supply as per desired volumes. According to unofficial estimates, the annual inflow of flowers to the State's flower market hovers around Rs. 7-8 crores paving out outflow of State's revenue in substantial quantum.It is now well accepted that in order to sustain agriculture as a profitable venture, due attention must be paid to selection of high value crop options that fetch higher return on investment per unit area. It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.﻿",

The Government of India provides interest subvention of 2% and Prompt Repayment Incentive of 3% to the farmers, thus making the credit available at a very subsidized rate of 4% per annum. The scheme was further extended for the investment credit requirement of farmers viz. allied and non-farm activities in the year 2004 and further revisited in 2012 by a working Group under the Chairmanship of Shri T. M. Bhasin, CMD, Indian Bank with a view to simplify the scheme and facilitate issue of Electronic Kisan Credit Cards. The scheme provides broad guidelines to banks for operationalizing the KCC scheme. Implementing banks will have the discretion to adopt the same to suit institution/location-specific requirements.﻿Objective / PurposeThe Kisan Credit Card scheme aims at providing adequate and timely credit support from the banking system under a single window with the flexible and simplified procedures to the farmers for their cultivation and other needs as indicated below :To meet the short term credit requirements for the cultivation of crops;Post-harvest expenses;Produce marketing loan;Consumption requirements of farmer household;Working capital for maintenance of farm assets and activities allied to agriculture;Investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities﻿Type of Card A magnetic stripe card with PIN (Personal Identification Number) with an ISO IIN (International Standards Organization International Identification Number) to enable access to all banks ATMs and micro ATMsIn cases where the Banks would want to utilize the centralized biometric authentication infrastructure of the UIDAI (Aadhaar authentication), debit cards with magnetic stripe and PIN with ISO IIN with biometric authentication of UIDAI can be provided.Debit Cards with magnetic stripes and only biometric authentication can also be provided depending on the customer base of the bank. Till such time, UIDAI becomes widespread, if the banks want to get started without inter-operability using their existing centralized bio metric infrastructure, banks may do so.Banks may choose to issue EMV (Europay, MasterCard and VISA, a global standard for the interoperation of integrated circuit cards) and RUPAY compliant chip cards with magnetic stripe and pin with ISO IIN.Further, biometric authentication and smart cards may follow the common open standards prescribed by IDRBT and IBA. This will enable them to transact seamlessly with input dealers and also enable them to have the sales proceeds credited to their accounts when they sell their output at mandies, procurement centres, etc﻿Delivery Channels :The following delivery channels shall be put in place to start with so that the Kisan Credit Card is used by the farmers to effectively transact their operations in their KCC account. Withdrawal through ATMs / Micro ATMWithdrawal through BCs using smart cards.PoS machine through input dealersMobile Banking with IMPS capabilities / IVRAadhaar enabled Cards﻿",

    "description": "The scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” was launched by the Department of Agriculture, Government of Himachal Pradesh by merging three ongoing protection based Departmental schemes namely Sour Badhbandi, Anti-Hail Net Structure & Green House Renovation Scheme into a single scheme having a common objective.The three components of the scheme are as under:1. Sour Badhbandi (Solar Fencing): Monkey and wildlife menace causes huge losses to crops annually in the State. The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.2. Anti-Hail Net Structure: Hailstorms in Himachal Pradesh are one of the major natural calamities resulting in substantial economic loss to the farmers by damaging standing vegetable crops both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme “Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)” was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojna” in the name of Anti Hail Nets. The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.3. Green House Renovation Scheme: Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme “Mukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme” in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” as a component namely Green House Renovation. Under this scheme, 70% assistance is being provided to the farmers for the replacement of poly sheets after 5 years of setting up of polyhouse or damage due to natural calamities.",

To address this issue, the Rajasthan Taarbandi Scheme was introduced, offering financial assistance to farmers across the state for the installation of fencing around their fields. This initiative aims to enable farmers to protect their crops effectively by erecting barbed wire enclosures around their fields.﻿Priority Scheduled Caste 17.83 percent,Scheduled Caste 13.48 percent,Women category farmers will be given priority for 30.0 percent participation.",
