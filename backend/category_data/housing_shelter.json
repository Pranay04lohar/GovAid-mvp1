    "description": "The scheme “Financial Aid for Providing Hostel Facility to Transgender Students” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. Transgender share the same hopes and dreams as any other individual in our society. 58% of Transgender students drop out before completing 10th grade (24% of Transgender students drop out even before completion of 9th grade). Reasons for this include- severe harassment making studies impossible and other gender-related negative experiences at school. In order to help such school dropouts continue their education, Social Justice Department has implemented a scholarship scheme for Transgender. The transgender community is still ostracized in society and cannot take up job offers or continue their education due to a lack of accommodation facilities. Though there has been improvement in the mindset of the people, still the stigma of giving transgender persons a house exists in society. Due to this problematic scenario, transgender who are pursuing the scholarship scheme are forced to discontinue their studies. For addressing this issue, the Department of Social Justice has introduced this scheme that provides an amount of ₹4,000/- per month as financial assistance to the Transgender community as rent for finding hostel facilities/accommodation.",

    "description": "The Government of West Bengal is determined to provide a `Basha’ (house) to all the people belonging to the Lower Income Group (LIG) and the Middle Income Group (MIG). There is a growing demand for housing amongst families belonging to the low and middle-income categories. In order to cater to the housing needs of the Lower Income Group and the Middle Income Group, the Housing Department felt the need to make provisions for affordable housing, and decided to introduce a new Housing Scheme, namely \"NIJASHREE HOUSING SCHEME\".Salient Features of The Scheme:The scheme envisages the construction of dwelling units of a minimum of 16 flats in a block of G + 3 buildings on the government lands, lands of local bodies, and other parastatals.1BHK flats, with a minimum built-up area of 35.15 square meters (378 sq. ft.), will be constructed for the LIG category, and 2BHK flats, having a minimum built-up area of 50.96 square meters (559 sq. ft.), will be constructed for the MIG category.The unit cost will be determined on the basis of the actual cost of construction of the superstructure, substructure, and internal infrastructure including sanitary and plumbing, internal electrification, etc., incidental therein.No cost of land shall be taken into account while computing the unit cost. This freehold land will be treated as a subsidy to the beneficiary.The unit cost and standard built-up area may vary, depending on the location and quantum of the land available, as well as the land development cost and the schedule of rates applicable to the area, at the time of construction.Off-site infrastructure like the construction of internal roads, boundary wall, outside electrification, making of a drainage system, installation of lights in the campus and water supply shall not be added to the cost of the housing development scheme NIJASHREE, i.e., the purchaser will not have to pay for such infrastructure.Credit-linked subsidies to the eligible beneficiaries will be facilitated by the Housing Department, as per the existing scheme.﻿",

    "description": "The government of Telangana formulated the double bed room housing scheme in the month of October 2015 with a view to providing dignity to the poor by providing 100% subsidized housing. There is no beneficiary contribution under this scheme which is one of its kind. In rural areas, beneficiaries solely depend on seasonal conditions for their earnings, the 2BHK housing helped in protecting them from debt traps as was the case in the past.﻿Hitherto the old yardstick was to provide a 260 sqft house with a single room; The \"Double Bedroom Housing\" provides two bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen and two toilets covering the 560 Sqft plinth area. The plot area is 125 sq yards for an independent house in a rural area and worked out to 36 Sq yards of undivided land share in G++ pattern houses in urban areas. The land is thus provided free of cost apart from the cost of the dwelling unit.﻿This is perhaps the only State in the Country to launch such a liberal scheme for the poor. Under this scheme, the beneficiaries neither take a loan nor contribute which is a great boon for rural and urban poor families, for acquiring a dwelling unit. It is a paradigm shift from a credit and subsidy-based scheme to a \"fully subsidized scheme\" which creates a sound economic asset with a hygienic living environment for the beneficiary, there by contributing enormously to the socio-economic growth of the individual and as well as the community.",
