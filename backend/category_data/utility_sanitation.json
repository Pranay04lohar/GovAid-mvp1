The main focus of GOBARDHAN is to keep villages clean, increase the income of rural households, and generate energy and organic manure from cattle waste. As rural India has already attained the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status, the importance of GOBARDHAN has increased as it supports the villages in achieving ODF-plus status, which is an important objective of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase II.﻿GOBARDHAN: Waste to Wealth program has been designed to provide a common platform for schemes of different Ministries/Departments such as the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE); Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG); Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD); Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DACFW); Department of Rural Development; and Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS). DDWS is the coordinating Department for the implementation of the scheme. DDWS also provides technical and financial assistance to States/UTs for the implementation of GOBARDHAN projects under SBM-G.﻿ObjectivesTo support villages in effectively managing their cattle waste, agricultural waste/residue, and all other organic wasteTo support communities to convert their organic waste (especially cattle dung) to wealth through the generation of manure and energy out of wasteTo create livelihood opportunities in rural areas and enhance the income of farmers and other rural people by supporting them to convert their waste to wealthTo promote rural entrepreneurship by involving entrepreneurs, SHGs, and Youth Groups in the setting up and operation and management of biogas plantsTo promote environmental sanitation and curb vector-borne diseases through effective disposal of waste in rural areas",

Suggestive technological solutions to address challenges in the supply of drinking water are as under:\n\nSolar energy based stand-alone water supply systems for scattered/ isolated/ tribal/ hilly villages.\nCommunity Water Purification Plant (CWPP) in groundwater contaminated areas.\nIn cold deserts, solutions may be explored to enhance and store run-off water in small tanks - traditional water harvesting structure, i.e. Zings of Ladakh. Further, artificial glacial reservoirs may be created by diverting the run-off to freeze & store as glacier.\nIn hard rock areas, bore-blast technique, fracture seal cementation, stream blasting, etc. may be explored.\nIn hilly areas, adopting spring-based sources, rain water harvesting and standalone bore-well systems (if feasible) will be explored.\nIn coastal areas, energy efficient small desalination plants with high recovery ratio will be explored, along with construction of sub-surface dykes in rivers.\nUse of Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information System (GIS) software, etc., will be required for planning and monitoring."
