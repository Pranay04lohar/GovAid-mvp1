1. Scrape All Scheme URLs by Category
Script: fetch_all_scheme_urls.py
Goal: Get a representative, high-quality set of scheme URLs for each category (as JSON files in output/).
Status: ✅ (You’ve completed this!)


2. Scrape Detailed Scheme Data
Script: scraper.py
Goal: For each scheme URL (from your output JSONs), extract all details (name, description, eligibility, benefits, docs, FAQs, etc.).
How:
Adapt scraper.py to read URLs from your output/ JSON files (instead of crawling the whole site).
For each URL, scrape and save the data to your SQLite database (yojnabuddy.db).
Status: 🟡 (You may need to tweak the script for batch processing from your URL lists.)

3. Validate and Clean the Data
Goal: Ensure your database has high-quality, non-duplicate, and complete scheme records.
How:
Run queries to check for missing fields, duplicates, or errors.
Optionally, write a small script to export the DB to CSV/JSON for manual review.


4. Build API Endpoints (Optional, but recommended)
Goal: Serve scheme data to your frontend in a structured way.
How:
Use Flask, FastAPI, or Django to build REST API endpoints (e.g., /schemes, /schemes/<id>, /categories).
These endpoints will query your SQLite DB and return JSON.


5. Integrate with Frontend
Goal: Display schemes, categories, and details in your frontend app.
How:
Fetch data from your backend API (or directly from the DB if your frontend is server-rendered).
Build UI components for listing, searching, and viewing scheme details.
6. Polish, Test, and Deploy
Test the full pipeline: scraping → DB → API → frontend.
Polish the UI/UX, add search/filter features, and handle edge cases.
Deploy your backend and frontend (e.g., on Heroku, Vercel, or your own server).
